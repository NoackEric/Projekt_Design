                        Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills
                        and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                        only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that
                        makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
                        daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
                        something nice and did not solve any problem.

                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.

                It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a
                taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to
                your surroundings.
